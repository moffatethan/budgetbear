# How it Works

For example, let's say Joe wants to save up for tuition that is due on August 30th, 2021. At the time of this writing, that is 194 days.

On average, Joe makes approximately $2,098 per month. This changes as their employment is hourly and shift based and this is deposited every 2 weeks on Friday.

Joe's tuition is set for $5,300. So, as his paycheck and any other additional deposits are divided based on days remaining with 6 months remaining we must put $884 per month away to meet our goal. 

So, as our paycheck comes in biweekly. Half will be put into the tuition account ($441.50) and the other half on the next paycheck. 

So, that is 42% of Joe's monthly income towards tuition. And he will have the groceries account, maybe he wants to spend $200 per month on food. 

$1,049 - $441.50 = $607.50

$607.60 - $100 = $507.50 (Food Account)

$507.50 is left in what is called "Free Money" account. This would typically be attached to a debit card for a real bank however, for the budget. This will be money Joe can spend.

# Pay Down Savings (Experiment)

I want to do a test with me psychologically, I have a spending issue. So I want to see instead of savings starting at zero, they start at the end goal and I pay down until I achieve my goals. For example, tuition is $5,300.

If Joe starts at $5,300 and just pay down the balance overtime, would he feel more obligated to follow it as it looks more like debt than actually saving but at the end you have the full amount + interest (having different savings accounts with your bank)!
